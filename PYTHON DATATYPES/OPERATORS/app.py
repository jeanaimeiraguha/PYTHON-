"""""
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

Arithmetic Operator

+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus	x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y

Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator	Example	Same As	
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
:=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
print(x)

Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
